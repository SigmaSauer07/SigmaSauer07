- 👋 Hi, I’m @SigmaSauer07 aka Sigma. I’m an artist who got robbed by platforms that promised royalties.  
So I spent 3 years coding Alsania, a blockchain that *forces* fair splits.  
I’m here to burn down the systems that exploit creators.
- 👀 I’m interested in technology, software and blockchain development and AI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more advanced blockchain development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any public project on my page.
- 📫 Contact me here
- 😄 I'm going to be starting a software development company run on blockchain technology.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am looking for a co-founder for the upcoming company. Need someone trustworthy,
- dedicated, cool, fun, good with people and innovative. Starting will just be like a hobby, fun,
- something to do on our free time. Slowly and securly building something great.
  Inbox me for more info or if your interested. Happy building!!!
